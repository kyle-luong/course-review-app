# CourseRate

This is a personal copy of a team project I worked on for CS 3240 at UVA. We built a desktop app that lets students search for courses and leave reviews.

### My Role

I led the team and helped guide development. I worked on backend logic, database integration, UI behavior, and testing, and helped keep the project on track throughout.

### Tech Highlights

Architecture: MVC  
UI: JavaFX  
Database: SQLite with JDBC  
Build & Testing: Gradle, JUnit, Mockito

This repo is just an archive of our team project so I can keep a record of my work, since the original classroom repo won’t be available forever.
